SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderDetails.OrderID, Products.ProductName, OrderDetails.Quantity
FROM OrderDetails
 JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID;


Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,



SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName, OrderDetails.Quantity, OrderDetails.ProductID
FROM ((Orders
 JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
 JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID);
